# siera_ai_fe_tech_challenge

### the app is hosted on
    https://dpresume.com/siera.ai

#### to start the app, command is:
    npm start or yarn
#### port is 3004 and can be changed from package.json

#### command to run the test case in console, without coverage is 
    yarn test

### antd vs material
    i have chosen antd as design component library for simple reason that i have used in past


#assumptions
#### selection Id is unique
#### api response will never be null or in error
#### hence have not written error boundary component here
#### have used Redux for central state management

#appologies:
###### due to short of time, I couldnt write enough test cases for the component and hence not checking coverage as part of this submission
###### I only have written the snapshot checks and api response checks
